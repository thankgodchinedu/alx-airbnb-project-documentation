# Airbnb Clone â€“ Backend Features and Functionalities

## Objective
Learners will identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend by understanding the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.

## Introduction
Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. In this project, the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone emphasize the features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements are categorized into **Core Functionalities**, **Technical Requirements**, and **Non-Functional Requirements**.
